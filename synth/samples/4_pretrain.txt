Once upon a time in a make-believe land, there was a big, big sunflowerbox filled with colorful flowers. The sunflowerbox was owned by Mr. Bunny, a kind bunny who loved to take care of his flowers. He would water them every morning and make sure they got plenty of sun. 

One day, as Mr. Bunny was outside, a strong gust of wind blew and made the sunflowerbox fall. Mr. Bunny was so sad because he lost all his beautiful flowers. He cried and cried, feeling very upset.

But wait! From a little hole, a tiny mouse named Missy saw everything. She felt bad for Mr. Bunny and decided to help. She ran quickly to gather some seeds and started planting new flowers in the sunflowerbox. Missy watered them with her small paws and waited patiently for them to grow.

When the flowers started blooming, they looked so pretty and colorful. All the animals in the forest admired them and felt happy again. Mr. Bunny was grateful to Missy for helping him, and he realized that even though he lost his flowers, his friendship with Missy was a treasure too. From that day on, the sunflowerbox became even more rich, filled not only with flowers but also with love and joy.
