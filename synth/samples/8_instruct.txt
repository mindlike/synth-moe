Story: Once upon a time, there was a happy little boy named Jimmy. Jimmy loved to play with his toy cars all day long. One sunny day, Jimmy's mommy was cooking some carrots on the stove. She told Jimmy not to touch the hot pot because it could boil and hurt him. But little Jimmy couldn't resist exploring.

As Jimmy approached the kitchen, he noticed a shiny wheel on the floor. Curious, he picked it up and started rolling it around. Suddenly, he heard a loud noise. It was the pot boiling and steam coming out. But Jimmy didn't understand the danger. He continued playing, rolling the wheel faster and faster, as the pot got hotter and hotter.

From the perspective of the wheel, it felt thrilled as Jimmy pushed it around. It spun and spun, feeling alive with each movement. But everything changed when Jimmy accidentally bumped the pot. It toppled over, spilling boiling water all over the kitchen floor. The wheel instantly became stuck in the hot mess.

From Jimmy's mommy's perspective, she gasped in horror. She rushed to rescue Jimmy, but it was too late. The boiling water splashed onto his feet, burning him badly.

Sadly, the story didn't have a good ending. Jimmy's feet were badly burned, and he had to go to the hospital. The wheel, once shiny and alive, was forever ruined by the boiling water. And Jimmy's mommy learned a valuable lesson to always keep dangerous things away from curious little ones.
