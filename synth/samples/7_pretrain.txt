Once upon a time, there was a piggie named Pinky. Pinky loved to dance and twirl around all day. Sometimes, Pinky would have dance parties inside the barn with all the other piggies. They would wiggle their tails and jump up and down with joy. Pinky was the best dancer, and everyone loved watching Pinky twirl.

One day, while Pinky was playing inside, a big storm suddenly came. The wind howled outside, and the rain poured down. The piggies were scared and huddled together. But Pinky had an idea. Pinky remembered a special dance move that could make the storm go away. So, Pinky closed his eyes and started dancing.

As Pinky danced, the storm outside began to calm down. The rain stopped falling, and the sun peeked out from behind the clouds. The other piggies were amazed and cheered for Pinky. They asked Pinky to teach them how to dance like that too. From that day on, they would always have dance parties inside the barn, even when it was raining. And they all lived happily ever after, dancing and having fun together.
