Once upon a time in a big town, there were four best friends named Bunny, Teddy, Kitty, and Ducky. They loved playing together every day. One sunny day, Bunny found a shiny frame in the garden. They all gathered around it and wondered what it was for. Bunny had an idea! They decided to take turns to put their pictures in the frame. Bunny went first, then Teddy, Kitty, and finally Ducky.

The friends were happy with their lovely pictures in the frame. They wanted to buy it so they asked their mommies and daddies for money. Bunny’s mommy gave them five shiny coins, Teddy’s daddy gave them three crinkly notes, Kitty’s mommy gave them two jingling coins, and Ducky’s daddy gave them two big coins. They counted the money and realized they had twelve coins in total. They went to the store and bought the frame.

But when they took it home, they saw something sour inside the frame. It wasn’t their pictures anymore! They were surprised and confused. They waited until dark to investigate. They saw a little squirrel playing with their pictures, taking them in and out of the frame. The friends giggled and asked the squirrel why it did that. The squirrel said that it wanted to have friends, too. Bunny, Teddy, Kitty, and Ducky were kind-hearted, so they let the squirrel join their playtime. From that day on, they shared their joyful moments with the squirrel, creating beautiful memories together.
