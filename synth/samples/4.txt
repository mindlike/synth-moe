Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Every night, she had a big problem. A monster lived under her bed and scared her. Lily would try to sleep, but the monster's growls and grumbles made her feel scared and sad. One evening, her mom came into the room. Lily told her about the monster and how he made her feel scared. Mom had an idea!

Mom took Lily to the front of the house, where there was a big machine. It was the wash machine! Mom explained that they would wash all the scary away. They took every toy, pillow, and blanket, and they put them in the machine. Lily giggled as the machine turned around and around. They waited for a while, then everything was clean and fresh.

That night, Lily climbed into her bed, feeling brave. The monster came out from under the bed, but this time, something was different. Lily remembered how the monster made her feel scared before. But now, she thought, maybe the monster was just lonely and wanted a friend. Lily decided to talk to the monster. And guess what? The monster just wanted someone to play with! From that day on, Lily and the monster became best friends, playing games and having fun together in her room. And they all lived happily ever after.
