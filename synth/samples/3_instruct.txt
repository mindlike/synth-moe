Story: Once upon a time, there was a lovely giraffe with a long neck named Timmy. Timmy lived in a big jungle with many different animals. One day, a mean lion called Sammy appeared and started to mock Timmy for having a flat neck. Timmy felt sad because he couldn't change his neck shape. 

All the other animals in the jungle watched as Sammy continued to make fun of Timmy. They didn't like Sammy being mean, but they were too scared to do anything about it. Timmy wished someone could help him stop Sammy's mocking.

But sadly, the story doesn't have a happy ending. One day, Sammy's words hurt Timmy's feelings so much that Timmy decided to leave the jungle forever. He felt so alone and sad that he wandered far away, searching for a place where he could be accepted just as he was. The jungle lost a beautiful friend because of Sammy's unkindness.
