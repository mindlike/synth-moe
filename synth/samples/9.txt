Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved going to school. Every day, she would wear her favorite pink dress and carry her shiny purple backpack. But something strange happened one day at school. Lily's teacher, Miss Rose, noticed that someone had pinched her sandwich during lunchtime. Everyone was puzzled and looked around to find the pinchy culprit.

Lily felt sad for her teacher because she knew how much Miss Rose loved her sandwich. She decided to solve the mystery and help her teacher. During recess, Lily asked her friends if they knew anything about the pinching incident. But no one had seen anything. The mystery seemed fixed, and Lily didn't know what to do.

As Lily sat on the swings, thinking hard, she saw a little squirrel with a mischievous grin. The squirrel had something pink in its tiny paw. Lily approached it slowly and saw that it was her teacher's missing sandwich! Lily realized that the squirrel must have taken the sandwich by mistake, thinking it was food for its little squirrel family. She gently took the sandwich from the squirrel and kindly explained that it belonged to Miss Rose.

Lily returned the sandwich to her teacher, who was surprised but relieved. The mystery was solved! Miss Rose thanked Lily for her detective work and asked her friends to promise never to pinch anyone's food again. Lily felt proud that she had done the right thing and helped her teacher. From that day on, everyone at school learned to be more careful and to share their snacks instead of pinching them.
