Once upon a time, there were lots of different friends who lived together in a big land. They all looked different from each other and liked to do different things. One day, they saw something wrong with Santa's reindeer. They knew they had to fix it, so they all decided to help.

First, they found some tools to repair the reindeer. They worked together and fixed it up really well. The reindeer was so happy! Then, they realized that this was not just about fixing Santa's reindeer. It was about being kind to all the different friends in their land.

They learned that it's important to help others, no matter what they look like or what they can do. They wanted to spread their message of love and kindness to everyone in the land. So, they all joined hands and sang a special song they made up together. It was a song that told everyone to be nice to others, even if they seem icky or different.

From that day on, all the friends in the land lived happily together. They learned that when they work together, they can make the world a better place for everyone. And Santa's reindeer? Well, it became a symbol of friendship and reminding others to treat everyone with respect, no matter how different they may be.
