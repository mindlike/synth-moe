Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had a long flashlight. Timmy likes to have his flashlight with him all the time. He would have it when he went to bed and have it when he played outside.

Timmy's long flashlight had a special power to make everything bright and shiny. It made him feel safe in the dark. But there was a problem. There was a mean dog named Max who didn't like Timmy. Max would chase Timmy whenever he saw him.

One day, Timmy started to cry. His mommy asked why he was sad. Timmy said that Max was always mean to him. Mommy told Timmy that Max had a sad story too. She told him that Max used to have a loving family, but they went away and left Max alone. This made Max feel very sad and scared.

After hearing Max's story, Timmy felt sorry for him. He decided to be friends with Max and share his long flashlight with him. Max no longer felt scared in the dark, and they became the best of friends, playing together happily ever after.
