Once upon a time, in a big green forest, there was a little squirrel named Nutty. He had a cozy home inside a tall tree with a leafy frame. Nutty's furry tail was very hairy and made him look super cute. He loved to climb trees, collect acorns, and play with his squirrel friends.

One sunny day, a little bird named Tweety flew by Nutty's tree. Nutty waved his tiny paw and said, "Hello, Tweety! How are you today?" Tweety chirped happily in reply, "I'm great, Nutty! Thanks for asking!"

Suddenly, dark clouds covered the sky, and a big thunderstorm began. Nutty quickly ran inside his tree for safety. But the storm was fierce, and a bolt of lightning hit the tree. The beautiful tree with its leafy frame came crashing down, breaking Nutty's home.

Nutty was scared and sad, but his friends came to help. They found a new home for Nutty in a little hole under a rock. Nutty thanked his friends and tried to be brave. However, he missed his old home dearly. It was a bad ending for Nutty, as he realized that sometimes things we love can be taken away by nature.

From that day on, Nutty never forgot the importance of appreciating his home and being grateful for every safe place he found.
