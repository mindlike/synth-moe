Story: Once upon a time, there was a big, strong panda named Kiki. Kiki loved to eat bamboo and play in the forest. One sunny day, as Kiki sat under a tall tree, he heard a loud shout. It was a little girl named Lily who wanted to play with Kiki.

Lily was very excited to see the big, strong panda. She hugged him tightly and giggled with joy. But Kiki was so strong that Lily couldn't hold him for long. Suddenly, Kiki started running all around the forest, swinging Lily in the air.

Lily shouted, "Stop, Kiki, stop!" But Kiki couldn't hear her. He was having too much fun. Lily's parents saw what was happening and shouted for Kiki to stop too. But Kiki was having too much fun to listen, and his strong grip didn't loosen.

Tired and scared, Lily started to cry. Kiki realized his mistake but it was too late. He gently put Lily down, but she was injured. Everyone was sad and worried. The once joyful day turned into a sad one. Kiki never meant to hurt Lily, but his strength had caused harm. From that day on, Kiki understood the importance of being careful with others.
