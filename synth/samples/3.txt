Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily had a brother named Jack, and he was very thin. They lived in a big city with many people and different kinds of friends.

One day, Lily and Jack went to the park. They played on the swings and slides, and had so much fun. But when it was time to go home, Lily remembered a special something. She told Jack, "Wait, I need to get my toy from yesterday!" 

Lily closed her eyes and remembered the day before. In her mind, she saw herself playing with her favorite doll near the fountain. She quickly told Jack about it and they ran to the fountain. They found the doll just where she had left it. 

Lily and Jack were happy. They walked back home, hand in hand, with big smiles on their faces. They were thankful that even though the day had been long, their toy and their brotherhood remained strong.
